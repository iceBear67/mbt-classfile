// When the code array is read into memory on a byte-addressable machine, 
// if the first byte of the array is aligned on a 4-byte boundary, the tableswitch and lookupswitch 32-bit offsets will be 4-byte aligned. 
// (Refer to the descriptions of those instructions for more information on the consequences of code array alignment.)
